## Answer the following Questions:
1. (2%) List out the equation to detect EX & MEM hazard in forwarding unit. Which part of the equation in textbook p. 369 is wrong?
    
    This part in p. 369 is wrong.

    It should be: 
    
    ```verilog=
    always @(*)
        if (EX_MEM_reg_write & EX_MEM_rd != 0 & EX_MEM_rd == ID_EX_rs) begin
            forward_A = 'b10;
        end else if (MEM_WB_reg_write & MEM_WB_rd != 0 & MEM_WB_rd == ID_EX_rs) begin
            forward_A = 'b01;
        end else begin
            forward_A = 'b00;
        end

    always @(*)
        if (EX_MEM_reg_write & EX_MEM_rd != 0 & EX_MEM_rd == ID_EX_rt) begin
            forward_B = 'b10;
        end else if (MEM_WB_reg_write & MEM_WB_rd != 0 & MEM_WB_rd == ID_EX_rt) begin
            forward_B = 'b01;
        end else begin
            forward_B = 'b00;
        end
    ```


2. (2%) In forwarding for `beq`, is forwarding from MEM/WB to ID needed? Why?

    Yes, it's needed because in my pipelined processor design, the branch decision is made in the ID stage. This means that the beq instruction must compare the values of the registers (rs and rt) in the ID stage to determine if the branch should be taken.
    
    Therefore, we need forwarding from MEM/WB to ID ensures that if the beq instruction requires a value that is currently being written back to the register file, the correct value is forwarded directly to the ID stage without waiting for it to be written back to the register file. For example `beq` right after `lw`.

3. (2%) Briefly explain how you insert 2 stalls when `beq` reads registers right after `lw` writes it.

    I add some extra signal, like `IF_ID_branch`, `EX_MEM_mem_to_reg` in `hazard_detection.v` to determine if `beq` is at ID stage and if `lw` is the previous instruction.
    
    For lw -> beq, after the first stall, `lw` enter EXE stage and `beq` is at ID stage, then I use `((EX_MEM_mem_to_reg & IF_ID_branch) & ((EX_MEM_write_reg == IF_ID_rs) | (EX_MEM_write_reg == IF_ID_rt)))` to set the second stall.
    
    ```verilog=
    assign stall = ((ID_EX_mem_read) & ((ID_EX_rt == IF_ID_rs) | (ID_EX_rt == IF_ID_rt))) | 
                    // e.g., lw -> add
                   ((EX_MEM_mem_to_reg & IF_ID_branch) & ((EX_MEM_write_reg == IF_ID_rs) | (EX_MEM_write_reg == IF_ID_rt))) | 
                    // e.g., lw -> beq
                    ((IF_ID_branch & ID_EX_reg_write) & ((ID_EX_rt == IF_ID_rs) |((ID_EX_rt == IF_ID_rt))); 
                    // e.g.,add -> beq
    ```

4. (2%) `sw` right after `lw` is quite common since copying and pasting data from one address to another is used frequently. In the textbook, a stall is followed by the `lw` in this case. Is it possible to remove this stall? How?

    Yes, this stall can be removed by forwarding write back data for `lw` in WB stage to write data for `sw` in MEM stage.
